# Wielder of Anor
Checks a user's staged files for "forbidden" words (as determined by the user)
and, if any are found, alerts the user to the locations of said words.

## Longer Description
I am absent-minded. Very absent-minded. Absent-minded to the point that I'll
throw some "puts" or "console.log" commands into my code for debugging purposes
only to completely forget about them and then happily push all my code to
master branch without a care in the world. This...is not okay. Yet despite my
constant reminders to my brain that it most certainly is not okay, it keeps
quite happily forgetting everything about everything when it's time to commit
my code. And since I (apparently) can't magically fix the way my brain works, I
figured I'd make my computer double-check me since, you know, that is the entire
reason we invented computers to begin with. Enter Wielder of Anor.

Wielder of Anor is a quick and easy way to ensure that you aren't pushing your
code to production (or anywhere else it shouldn't be) with "forbidden words" you
don't want there. You yourself determine which words are forbidden, so this app
should be helpful to anyone wanting to prevent certain text from making it past
your dev environment. Maybe you're like me and you can never remember to pull
your debugging commands out of your code before committing. Maybe you're a code
master and commit swaths of code at a time, laughing at the mere mortals around
you who commit smaller chunks of work several times a day, and you can't be
bothered to check through your tens of thousands of lines of code to ensure you
didn't leave some debugging command in there somewhere. Or maybe your code gets
more and more filled with swear words the more frustrating a problem gets and
you just can't let one of those slip to production again because seriously it'd
be like the third or fourth time and you like working here and can't imagine
staying here if you slip up another time or two and...

Ahem. Sorry.

So. If you need to prevent anything in your code from making it past your dev
environment and need a reliable way to do this, use Wielder of Anor.

## Setup
To setup Wielder of Anor,Â download it to your computer and unzip it to its own
directory where you'd like. Then, open up config/example_config.yaml and follow
the instructions in there. It's open for you to configure it to your liking, or
you can just use the defaults I have listed.

After you've set that up, put your forbidden words into the file you specified
in forbidden_words_file_location, with each one separated by new lines. Here's
a sample:

```
puts
console
log
print
```

## Use/What It Does
To use Wielder of Anor, just run it *from within your code directory* (this is
important). You can pass in a couple of arguments here:

* The first argument is your eventual commit message (in quotes), if you've
  chosen to allow Wielder of Anor itself to run your commits for you. It is
  unnecessary if you've chosen not to allow it to run your commits for you.
* The second argument can only be '1' and can only be added if there is a commit
  message as the first argument. If this argument is passed, Wielder of Anor
  will skip checking for any forbidden words whatsoever and jump straight to the
  commit portion of the app. This is mainly here so that you can easily force a
  commit after Wielder of Anor tells you of some forbidden words that you've
  decided to allow for whatever reason. For instance, say 'puts' is one of your
  forbidden words and there's a commented-out puts statement in your code
  that you didn't put there and that, as such, you don't want to delete. It's
  the only forbidden word showing up, so the rest of your code is clean. So,
  instead of now having to type out a full git commit command, you can now just
  hit your up arrow, hit the spacebar, type a '1' and hit enter.
  
Once run, Wielder of Anor will run a bash command that'll export the result of a
`git diff HEAD` (so all files in your local branch that are different from git
HEAD) to a file. It'll then check every line in every one of those files for any
of your forbidden words and print out the locations of any it finds.

If it found none (or if you've skipped the search and are forcing a commit), you
are good to go and can tell the app to then run the git commit command, if
you've opted to allow it to do so. At this point, Wielder of Anor will run a
`git commit -a -m ` followed by your commit message (your first argument when
running the app). Once it prints out "COMMITTED.", execution will end.

## Wielder of Anor? Wut.
You know, the thing Gandalf calls himself to the Balrog as he's all "YOU SHALL
NOT PASS!" over and over? When he's, you know, preventing the Balrog from
getting past him? He...he prevents a *forbidden* thing from...

A gatekeeper. This app is a gatekeeper. Gandalf was a Gatekeeper that one
time. It's artistic. Or something.
